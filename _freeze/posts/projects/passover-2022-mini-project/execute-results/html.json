This information should include:\n* location (e.g.: balcony in Rechovot, kitchen in Gan-Yavne, 7th floor bedroom window, etc.),\n* what the sensors are measuring (including the \"unique\" sensor/s), and\n* any other information that you find relevant - the more the better.\n \nUpload interval should be *at least every 3 minutes* (not longer). Please don't upload every second if there is no justification (for example the humidity in the bedroom will change slowly, so no need for rapid measurments).\n\n### <span class=\"iconify\" data-icon=\"fa-solid:binoculars\"></span> Public view\n\nWe will be monitoring your Thingspeak channels via the \"Public view\" section. It is very simple to make your channel public, just check \"Share channel view with everyone\" under the Sharing tab as you can this in the following image:  \n\n![](/archive/figures/shared_view.jpg)\n\n### <span class=\"iconify\" data-icon=\"ic:baseline-power\"></span> How to power your projects\n\nOnce the code is uploaded to the ESP32 and every thing works fine, you don't need your computer anymore, and can use a generic USB charger as a power supply. Don't worry about the code, it will work as long as the ESP32 has power, because you already uploaded the code to memory. \n\n### Calculate VPD\n\n<!-- ![]({{ site.url }}/archive/figures/VPD.png) -->\n\n\nThe Vapor Pressure Deficit (VPD, in kPa) is the difference between saturation vapor pressure $e_s$ and actual vapor pressure $e_d$:\n\n$$\\text{VPD} = e_s - e_d.$$\n\nFor temperatures ranging from 0 to 50 Â°C, the saturation vapor pressure can be calculated with\n\n$$\ne_s = \\exp \\left[ \\frac{16.78\\, T -116.9}{T+237.3} \\right],\n$$\n\nand the actual vapor pressure is given by\n\n$$\ne_d = e_s \\frac{RH}{100},\n$$\n\nwhere $RH$ is the relative humidity (%), and the temperature $T$ in the equations above is in degrees Celcius.\n\n",
