In this guid you will learn how to install needed software on your computer.  \n\nFull documentation of this MCU can be found on the [product wiki](https://wiki.dfrobot.com/FireBeetle_Board_ESP32_E_SKU_DFR0654) by DFRobot.\n\n---\n\nFollow these simple steps to install FireBeetle 2 MCU on the Arduino IDE on your computer:\n\n1. Add the json link in IDE\n2. Download the core of the maincontroller\n3. Select development board and serial port\n\n\n## 1. Add URL to Ardudino IDE\n\nOpen Arduino IDE, click `File->Preferences`, as shown below:\n\n![Arduino IDE](/archive/figures/IDE-file-pref.png)\n\nClick the icon marked with red below.\n\n![Arduino Setup](/archive/figures/IDE-pref.png)\n\nCopy the address to the newly popped up box: `http://download.dfrobot.top/FireBeetle/package_DFRobot_index.json`\n\n![Arduino Setup 1](/archive/figures/IDE-url.png)\n\nClick OK.\n\n## 2. Update board. \nOpen `Tools->Board->Boards Manager`.\n\n![Update Board](/archive/figures/IDE-boards-manager.png)\n\nThe board manager will be automatically updated.\n\n![Board Updated](/archive/figures/IDE-boards-manager2.png)\n\nWait for a while, then type in the search bar `DFRobot ESP32` in the list. Click \"Install\" (in the image its gayed out because it's already installed...):\n\n![Install Board](/archive/figures/DFRobot.png)\n\nOnce you see \"INSTALLED\" in Blue you are Done! You can find the installed `FireBeetle-ESP32` board in the list now.\n\n\n## 3. Select board and port\n\nOnce the board is installed, select it: \nOpen `Tools->Board->DFRobot ESP32 Arduino->FireBeelte ESP32-E`\n![choose board](/archive/figures/dfrobott.png)\n\nThen select the Port  \nOpen `Tools->Port->COMxx` (for windows the port wil be `COM` with some number, for Mac/linux it will be `/dev/cu.` and then something).  \nHow do you know what port to choose?  \nCheck the ports without the MCU pluged into the computer. Then plug the MCU and check the ports again. If you see a new port, thats the port of the MCU. \n\n## Troubleshooting\n\nTroubleshooting if there is no port for the MCU:\n\n 1. Missing driver. Could be you need to install a specific driver.  \n [Windows driver](https://dfimg.dfrobot.com/nobody/wiki/0e0d6b3864f7163833ec5d7ad4af7632.EXE)  \n [MacOS driver](https://dfimg.dfrobot.com/nobody/wiki/c195a13df2a1989d5dc04e76e6bcb701.ZIP)\n 2. Bad USB cable. Some cables are bad and some are only for charging and cannot sync data. Try using a different USB cable that worked for a freind.\n\n",
