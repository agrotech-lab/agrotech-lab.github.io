Press on `MATLAB Visualization` box, on the top right.\n1. From `Templates`, choose `Create a 2-D line plot`, then press `Create`.\n1. In case the template doesn't load, you can create a custom visualization and paste the code below\n\n```{.matlab code-line-numbers=\"1\"}\n% Template MATLAB code for visualizing data from a channel as a 2D line\n% plot using PLOT function.\n\n% Prior to running this MATLAB code template, assign the channel variables.\n% Set 'readChannelID' to the channel ID of the channel to read from. \n% Also, assign the read field ID to 'fieldID1'. \n\n% TODO - Replace the [] with channel ID to read data from:\nreadChannelID = [];\n% TODO - Replace the [] with the Field ID to read data from:\nfieldID1 = [];\n\n% Channel Read API Key \n% If your channel is private, then enter the read API\n% Key between the '' below: \nreadAPIKey = '';\n\n%% Read Data %%\n\n[data, time] = thingSpeakRead(readChannelID, 'Field', fieldID1, 'NumPoints', 30, 'ReadKey', readAPIKey);\n\n%% Visualize Data %%\n\nplot(time, data);\n```\n\n[Read here more about arguments that function `thingSpeakRead` can receive](https://www.mathworks.com/help/thingspeak/thingspeakread.html?searchHighlight=thingSpeakRead&s_tid=srchtitle_thingSpeakRead_1)\n\n\n## Python\n\nWe will be using Jupyter Notebook as our python interface.\nThere are many ways of running python, we chose Jupyter because it allows for easy prototyping, and the Markdown cells are great for documentation.\n\n[Jupyter Notebook](https://yairmau.github.io/website/jupyter/2020/03/01/basic-tsa.html){: .button}\n\n",
