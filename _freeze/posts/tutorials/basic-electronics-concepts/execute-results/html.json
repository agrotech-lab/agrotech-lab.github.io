[What is Electricity?](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/what-is-electricity)\n1. [Electric Power](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/electric-power)\n1. [Voltage, Current, Resistance, and Ohm's Law](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/voltage-current-resistance-and-ohms-law)\n1. [What is a Circuit?](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/what-is-a-circuit)\n1. [How to Use a Multimeter](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-to-use-a-multimeter)\n1. [Voltage Dividers](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/voltage-dividers/all)\n1. [How to Use a Breadboard](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-to-use-a-breadboard)\n\nThere is no end to learning about these topics!\nThe good news is that you can accomplish *a lot* of stuff with the very basic notions of electric circuits. If you want to learn even more, navigate your way on the \"Suggested Reading\" section in the tutorials above.\n\n## Other Links\n\n#### What is an LED?\n\n* [From electronics-tutorials.ws](https://www.electronics-tutorials.ws/diode/diode_8.html)\n* [From Sparkfun](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/light-emitting-diodes-leds/all)\n\n#### Thermistor Tutorial\n\n* [From Adafruit](https://learn.adafruit.com/thermistor/using-a-thermistor)\n* [Model equations and calculator of constants for thermistors](https://www.thinksrs.com/downloads/programs/therm%20calc/ntccalibrator/ntccalculator.html)\n\n",
