We want to give you the freedom to try out all the equipment, but we need help in tracking what equipment you took. For that reson we started a colaborative spreadsheet in which you can list the equipment you took home / are using in your project. (Only HUJI accounts can edit that sheet).  
[<i class="bi bi-file-earmark-spreadsheet-fill"></i> Link to sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13QnEzeFD3zJkL6Tm_SBLfyFS0dUWazhqZs1YpUDvdco/edit?usp=sharing)

### About the sheet & some guidelines:
* Each unique component has its own column, including its name, brief description and link to a picture of it.
* One row per student (please add yourself).
* Insert the amount you took of each component in numbers only.
* In the _Graveyard_ section write in text (example: 2 x ESP32) all the equipment that you burnt, found malfunctioning, lost, etc... Whatever we can't use anymore... **IMPORTANT:** there is no shame in having a big list, honesty is what we are looking for. We are just trying to keep track of all the equipment.
* Please make sure to immediately update the sheet as you take/return the equipment.
* No need to list super-fundamental equipment like resistors and cables.

### We need your help:
The sheet is not complete and will be expanded during the semester. If there is missing information, please add/fix it. 
It can be:  

* Missing component column  
* No description  
* No image link
