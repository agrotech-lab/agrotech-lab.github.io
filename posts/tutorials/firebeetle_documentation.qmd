| Touch      | Pin with capacitive touch function                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Analog     | Analog pin                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Port PIN   | Default physical pin number of the chip, which can be used to directly control the corresponding pin                                                                                                                                                             |
| Arduino IDE| In Arduino IDE, the pin numbers have been remapped by FireBeetle, and you can directly use this symbol to control the corresponding pin                                                                                                                            |
| RTC PIN    | FireBeetle 2 ESP32-E supports low power function, and in Deep-sleep mode, only RTC pin keeps working and can be used as a wave-up source. When RTC pin is used as an output pin, it keeps outputting level value when the chip is in Deep-sleep mode, while as an input pin, it can wake up the chip from Deep-sleep. |
| GND        | Common ground for all power supplies and logics                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Power      | When powered by 5V-USB, VCC outputs about 4.7V and 3V3 outputs 3.3V; When powered by 4V li-ion battery, VCC outputs about 4V and 3V3 outputs 3.3V(Actual measurement)                                                                                              |
