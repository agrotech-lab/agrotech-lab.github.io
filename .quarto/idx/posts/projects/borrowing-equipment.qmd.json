For that reson we started a colaborative spreadsheet in which you can list the equipment you took home / are using in your project. (Only HUJI accounts can edit that sheet).  \n[<i class=\"bi bi-file-earmark-spreadsheet-fill\"></i> Link to sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13QnEzeFD3zJkL6Tm_SBLfyFS0dUWazhqZs1YpUDvdco/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n* Each unique component has its own column, including its name, brief description and link to a picture of it.\n* One row per student (please add yourself).\n* Insert the amount you took of each component in numbers only.\n* In the _Graveyard_ section write in text (example: 2 x ESP32) all the equipment that you burnt, found malfunctioning, lost, etc... Whatever we can't use anymore... **IMPORTANT:** there is no shame in having a big list, honesty is what we are looking for. We are just trying to keep track of all the equipment.\n* Please make sure to immediately update the sheet as you take/return the equipment.\n* No need to list super-fundamental equipment like resistors and cables.\n\n### We need your help:\nThe sheet is not complete and will be expanded during the semester. If there is missing information, please add/fix it. \nIt can be:  \n\n* Missing component column  \n* No description  \n* No image link  "},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":true,"echo":false,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"jupyter"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","include-before-body":["../../_custom_header.html"],"css":["../../custom.scss"],"highlight-style":"breezedark","output-file":"borrowing-equipment.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.269","theme":["flatly","../../custom.scss"],"title-block-banner":true,"title":"Borrowing equipment","author":"agrotech\"","date":"2022-04-12","categories":["project"],"jupyter":"python3"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
