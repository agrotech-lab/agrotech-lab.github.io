[What is Electricity?](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/what-is-electricity)\n1. [Electric Power](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/electric-power)\n1. [Voltage, Current, Resistance, and Ohm's Law](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/voltage-current-resistance-and-ohms-law)\n1. [What is a Circuit?](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/what-is-a-circuit)\n1. [How to Use a Multimeter](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-to-use-a-multimeter)\n1. [Voltage Dividers](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/voltage-dividers/all)\n1. [How to Use a Breadboard](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-to-use-a-breadboard)\n\nThere is no end to learning about these topics!\nThe good news is that you can accomplish *a lot* of stuff with the very basic notions of electric circuits. If you want to learn even more, navigate your way on the \"Suggested Reading\" section in the tutorials above.\n\n## Other Links\n\n#### What is an LED?\n\n* [From electronics-tutorials.ws](https://www.electronics-tutorials.ws/diode/diode_8.html)\n* [From Sparkfun](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/light-emitting-diodes-leds/all)\n\n#### Thermistor Tutorial\n\n* [From Adafruit](https://learn.adafruit.com/thermistor/using-a-thermistor)\n* [Model equations and calculator of constants for thermistors](https://www.thinksrs.com/downloads/programs/therm%20calc/ntccalibrator/ntccalculator.html)"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":true,"echo":false,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"jupyter"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","include-before-body":["../../_custom_header.html"],"css":["../../custom.scss"],"highlight-style":"breezedark","output-file":"basic-electronics-concepts.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.269","theme":["flatly","../../custom.scss"],"title-block-banner":true,"title":"Basic Electronics Concepts","date":"2022-03-09","categories":["arduino"],"jupyter":"python3"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
