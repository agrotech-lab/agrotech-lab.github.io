Unless stated otherwise, every assignment should be submitted according to the following guidelines:

1. **Upload code and supporting materials** (such as schematics, wiring diagrams, etc.) to **Moodle**.
2. Using the **Google Form** linked in the Moodle assignment, upload a short **video** (up to 2 minutes) showing the following:
   1. The **hardware** you built  
   2. The **software** you wrote (e.g., running code, interface, or serial output)  
   3. A **short demonstration** showing that it works  
   4. **You** in the video (so we can confirm it’s your work)  
   5. You should **speak throughout** the video and explain what we’re seeing.

Below is an example video: 
  

<div style="text-align: center;">
  <iframe width="315" height="560"
          src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iCTo-jlNfLs"
          title="Example homework video"
          frameborder="0"
          allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"
          allowfullscreen>
  </iframe>
</div>

> ⚠️ **Note:** The video does *not* need to be edited or polished. A simple recording from your phone is perfect. The goal is to show that your system works and that you understand what you’ve built — not to create a fancy production.
