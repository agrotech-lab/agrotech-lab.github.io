## Goal

Build an **ESP32 clock & weather station** that:

- shows **time** and **temperatures** on an **OLED**
- measures **indoor temperature** (SHT31) and **outdoor temperature** (DS18B20)
- uploads data to **ThingSpeak**

## Hardware (minimum)

- ESP32
- SHT31 temperature & humidity sensor (indoor)
- DS18B20 / DS18x20 temperature sensor (outdoor)
- I2C OLED 


## What your project must do

1. **Display on the OLED**
   - current time (HH:MM, with seconds optional)  
   - indoor temperature (from SHT31)  
   - outdoor temperature (from DS18B20)  
   - temperature difference (for example: `ΔT = Tout − Tin`)

2. **Upload to ThingSpeak**
   - use your own ThingSpeak channel  
   - send at least:  
     - field 1: indoor temperature  
     - field 2: outdoor temperature  
     - field 3: temperature difference 

3. **Use real sensor readings**
   - no fake / random values  
   - both sensors must be wired and working

## Bonus ideas (optional)

- show a **weather forecast** (for example, today’s max temperature from an online API)  
- add **controls** (buttons or web server) to change display mode or update rate  
- add **alarms** if ΔT is larger than some threshold
- recommendations - open window or turn on/off AC
- log extra variables to ThingSpeak (humidity, min/max, etc.)
- be creative!

## What to submit

- link to your **ThingSpeak channel**  
- short **video**  showing the project 
- your **code** (`.ino` or project folder)
- **schematics** in `.pdf` format
