You will write Arduino code that incorporates all the following elements learned in [First programs](/tutorials/first-programs.html). Upload your `.ino` file on the course's Moodle page. You'll have two weeks until deadline.

* variable declaration, e.g.
  ```cpp
  float my_var=1.23;
  int i, j;
  ```
* function declaration, e.g.
  ```cpp
  int my_sum(int x, int y) {
    return x + y;
  }
  ```
* Built-in and external LED control
* Conditionals, e.g.
  ```cpp
  if (temperature > 30.0) {
    fan = 1;
  } else {
    fan = 0;
  }
  ```
* Random numbers, e.g.
  ```cpp
  // random number from -5 (inclusive) to +5 (exclusive)
  rand1 = random(-5, 5);
  ```
* Serial plotting, numbers and text
* Comments explaining every step of what you did
* **Bonus**: connect to WiFi and make use of time from the internet
* **Obligatory**: at the very top of your code, write in many lines an explanation (in English) of what your code does
