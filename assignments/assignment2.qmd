Create a small project where you **control** an output device (such as LEDs, relays, etc.) based on changes in an input, like temperature or humidity readings.

**Bonus:** Include LED brightness control using PWM.

This assignment is basically the [Challenges](/tutorials/control.html#challenges) section from the lecture on control.

Upload the .ino file, ensuring you include a few lines of comments at the beginning of the code to explain what the project does.
