## {{< iconify akar-icons github-fill >}} Github 

Make an account on [Github](https://github.com).
Create a repository called "agrotech" or whatever you else want to call it.
You can upload to this repository your code, data, diagrams, pictures, markdown, etc.
In the end of the semester you will upload your project report as a Jupyter Notebook file.

From now on, your main Github page can be your "geek face" on the internet. Make a clean and simple `readme.md`, telling the world who you are and what you do.

## {{< iconify simple-icons jupyter >}} Jupyter Notebook 

The easiest way to install Python (+ Jupyter Notebook, Spyder, PyCharm, JupyterLab, etc) on any OS is to download [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual).
Jupyter Notebook is a versatile environment that allows you to write code and documentation in one single file, taking advantage of Markdown.
Click for a [short](https://devhints.io/markdown) and a [long](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) markdown cheat sheet.
