The ESP32 board we are using has an built in RGB LED on pin `D8`. The following code is an example of how to use it. Please note that it requires the installation of the `"Freenove_WS2812_Lib_for_ESP32.h"` library. It can be found in the Arduino IDE library manager or downloaded from [the github repository](https://github.com/Freenove/Freenove_WS2812_Lib_for_ESP32). If you are not sure how to install a library follow our [guide](/tutorials/libraries.html).


```{python}
#| echo: false
#| output: asis
code_source("rgb.ino")
```
