## Very Basic Concepts

You should be familiar with the very basics of how electricity works.
There are a million books and websites to learn from.
We suggest the following webpages, written by Sparkfun, a big vendor of electronics.


1. [What is Electricity?](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/what-is-electricity)
1. [Electric Power](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/electric-power)
1. [Voltage, Current, Resistance, and Ohm's Law](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/voltage-current-resistance-and-ohms-law)
1. [What is a Circuit?](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/what-is-a-circuit)
1. [How to Use a Multimeter](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-to-use-a-multimeter)
1. [Voltage Dividers](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/voltage-dividers/all)
1. [How to Use a Breadboard](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-to-use-a-breadboard)

There is no end to learning about these topics!
The good news is that you can accomplish *a lot* of stuff with the very basic notions of electric circuits. If you want to learn even more, navigate your way on the "Suggested Reading" section in the tutorials above.
