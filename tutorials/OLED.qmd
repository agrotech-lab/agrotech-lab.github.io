A screen is an essential component in many projects, offering a visual interface to communicate information to users. Here are some general uses and benefits:

1. **Real-Time Data Display**: Screens allow you to show real-time data such as sensor readings, system status, or user instructions, making the device more interactive and user-friendly.

2. **Debugging and Monitoring**: During development, a screen can be invaluable for debugging and monitoring the performance of your system, showing error messages or status updates.

3. **User Interaction**: Screens enable user interaction by displaying menus, prompts, or feedback, making the device intuitive and easy to use.

4. **Aesthetic and Functional Design**: Adding a screen enhances both the aesthetics and functionality of a project, giving it a polished and professional look.

A screen bridges the gap between technology and the user by providing clear, accessible communication.
