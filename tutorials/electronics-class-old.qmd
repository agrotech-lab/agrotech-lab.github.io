## Digital Write

Use the following code to activate LED pin.

```{python}
#| echo: false
#| output: asis
code_source("digital-write.ino")
```



## PWM with ESP32

Pulse-width modulation (PWM) is a method of controlling the average power delivered by an electrical signal. The average value of voltage (and current) fed to the load is controlled by switching the supply between 0 and 100% at a rate faster than it takes the load to change significantly. **PWM is a technique for getting analog results with digital means.** Digital control is used to create a square wave, a signal switched between on and off. This on-off pattern can simulate voltages in between the full Vcc of the board and off by changing the portion of time the signal spends on versus the time that the signal spends off. PWM is used in many applications such as controlling motor speed, heat output of heaters and variable speed fan controllers.

Use the following code to activate LED pin with PWM.

```{python}
#| echo: false
#| output: asis
code_source("PWM-basic.ino")
```


## Reading an Analog Pin

Use the following code to read an analog pin.

```{python}
#| echo: false
#| output: asis
code_source("analog-read.ino")
```


## ADC to voltage

Use the following code to convert ADC reading to voltage.

```{python}
#| echo: false
#| output: asis
code_source("ADC-to-voltage.ino")
```


## Potentiometer and PWM

Use the following code to control PWM with potentiometer and dim the LED.

```{python}
#| echo: false
#| output: asis
code_source("potentiometer-PWM.ino")
```

## Thermistor
